# Crystal Collector #

## How to play ##
Each time you load the game, the four crystals will have new, random values between 1 and 12. There is a target number you must hit without going over, like Blackjack. Go over and you lose. The game logs your wins and losses.

## How it works ##
Crystal Collector is a simple Javascript game using jQuery selectors and Wow.js for animations. It keeps track of wins and losses. 

Aside from watermarks I didn't want to remove from the copyrighted pictures, I'm happy with how it looks, especially for one of my first apps.
